# Anti Canada Post Scammer Script
 This is a Proof of concept script I made to show someone how you would potentially bypassing simple checks and load there database with fake user information generated by randomuser.me API. 

This was not used in live production as it could be considered a Denial of Service. 

Note that the CC number used is a valid one but it is used for testing purposes, and will be denied when attempted. According to connections in retail, this will cause the merchant (in this case the scammer), to be charged a $0.25 fee at each failed attempt. Unfortunately, its not fully known if this is working or not.

## Goals

- Load the scammers database with fake information:
  - Full Names
  - Address
  - Social Insurance Numbers
  - Credit Card Numbers
  - Maiden Names
- Potential Credit Card Fee's for failed payments
